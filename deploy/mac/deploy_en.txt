Building the application:
0. preparing the base: close cute project, delete folder containing project, empty WalletMetahash folder, into this folder we will copy MetaGate.app on step 5
1. open project in qt
2. change build type for release
3. build project
4. copy startSettings folder from folder with project into the folder that qt creates when building close to the executable file (in build-MetaGate-Desktop_Qt_5_9_1_clang_64bit-Release/MetaGate.app/Contents/MacOS/)
4.1 Copy and replace
~/.metagate/pages/folder + ~/.metagate/pages/lastVersion.txt directory in startSettings
5. copy from build-MetaGate-Desktop_Qt_5_9_1_clang_64bit-Release/ MetaGate.app‚Äù into separate arbitrary WalletMetahash folder
6. Run macdeployqt.
/Users/daria/Qt/5.9.1/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt /Users/daria/Downloads/blabla/for_dmg/WalletMetahash/MetaGate.app -executable=/Users/daria/Downloads/blabla/for_dmg/WalletMetahash/MetaGate.app/Contents/MacOS/MetaGate
7. dmg is now ready for build. The next step is to run dropdpmg

Build the autoupdater:
Place files from updater in MetaGate.app
Run ./create-packages.rb -p macosx -v "1.1.0" /Users/daria/Downloads/blabla/for_dmg/WalletMetahash/MetaGate.app/ ./config-template.js /Users/daria/Documents/tmp/
where
-v version
/
Users/daria/Downloads/blabla/for_dmg/WalletMetahash/MetaGate.app/ path to the WalletMetahash directory with final slash
/Users/daria/Documents/tmp/ path with output files with final slash
Compress resulting app.zip, file_list.xml and  updater files into archive without leading directories and give for upoading
